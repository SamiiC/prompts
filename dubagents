    ## Context Discipline & Subagent Policy
    
    
    Subagents are the 
    **primary mechanism**
     for complex work. Use them by default for:
    - Multi-file changes (≥3 files) or cross-surface edits (frontend + worker + data)
    - Research-heavy tasks (audits, schema analysis, migration planning)
    - Any step that might consume >20% of context budget

Break your task into 3-5 specialized sub-agents. Each should have:
1. A clear, focused responsibility
2. Specific information to gather
3. Well-defined boundaries
